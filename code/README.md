# AI Systems Performance Engineering

## Summary
Reference implementation of high-performance PyTorch, CUDA, and Triton workloads for NVIDIA Blackwell platforms.
The repository packages 20 focused chapters, advanced labs, and the shared benchmarking harness so you can profile baselines, apply optimizations, and capture artifacts that prove performance gains.

## Learning Goals
- Understand how the chapters, labs, and shared tooling fit together.
- Stand up a reproducible environment for PyTorch 2.10-dev + CUDA 13 workloads on Blackwell GPUs.
- Run the benchmark harness directly or through the Typer CLI for automated artifact capture.
- Validate peak hardware characteristics before grading optimizations against stored expectations.

## Directory Layout
| Path | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `ch01` - `ch20` | One directory per chapter with baseline/optimized benchmarks, workload configs, and chapter-level harness entrypoints such as `ch01/compare.py`. |
| `labs/` | Deep-dive labs for matmul, routing, FlexAttention, MoE, persistent decode, distributed training, and more. |
| `core/benchmark/`, `profiling/`, `core/`, `optimization/`, `analysis/` | Shared harness, logging, workload metadata, profiling, and optimization utilities used by every chapter. |
| `python -m cli.aisp bench` | Typer-based CLI for running and profiling targets with reproducible artifacts. |
| `docs/` + `core/scripts/` | Operational guides, profiling workflows, and setup/reset helpers (`setup.sh`, `cleanup.py`, `reset-gpu.sh`). |

## Running the Benchmarks
Use the benchmark harness for quick comparisons or drive the Typer CLI when you need repeatable artifact capture.
```bash
cd ai-performance-engineering
python3 -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements_latest.txt
python -m cli.aisp bench list-targets --chapter ch01
python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch01 --profile minimal
```
- `setup.sh` installs system prerequisites (drivers, CUDA, Nsight) and should be rerun after driver upgrades.
- Use `python -m cli.aisp bench expectations --hardware b200 --min-speedup 1.05` to report expectation entries below a target threshold.
- Use `python -m cli.aisp bench run --targets ch*` for automated regression suites.
- `python core/analysis/analyze_expectations.py --artifacts-dir artifacts` compares new runs to stored thresholds.

## Validation Checklist
- `pytest tests/integration` succeeds to confirm harness discovery and CLI plumbing.
- `python core/benchmark/benchmark_peak.py` reports TFLOP/s, bandwidth, and NVLink numbers close to the published ceilings.

## Wall of Shame
The benchmark harness includes a strict set of correctness and validity checks to prevent misleading speedups.
Below is the reference list of validity issues we explicitly protect against, plus real-world incidents that
motivated these checks.

Note: All 95 validity issues are protected by the harness.

CUDA Graph Note: Capturing CUDA graphs in `setup()` is allowed for steady-state replay benchmarks (we intentionally
measure replay, not capture). It is NOT allowed to precompute and reuse the final output from `setup()`. The output
used for verification must come from the timed `benchmark_fn()` run and be surfaced via `capture_verification_payload()`.

Virtualization Note: `validate_environment()` treats virtualization (hypervisor present) as invalid. Benchmarks are
supported only on bare metal.

### Deep Dive: The Locus/KernelBench Stream Timing Vulnerability

This 2025 incident illustrates why correctness verification alone is insufficient.

```python
# VULNERABLE TIMING (what KernelBench did)
start_event.record(original_model_stream)  # Only records on default stream
model(*inputs)                              # But work runs on s1, s2, s3
end_event.record(original_model_stream)    # Timer stops before s1/s2/s3 finish
torch.cuda.synchronize(device=device)      # Waits, but timing already recorded

# CORRECT TIMING (the fix)
for stream in custom_model_streams:
    custom_model_stream.wait_stream(stream)  # Wait for ALL streams
_event.record(custom_model_stream)           # Then record timing
```

The exploit pattern:
1. AI creates non-default streams: `s1 = getStreamFromPool()`, `s2 = ...`, `s3 = ...`
2. AI launches GEMMs on those streams: `at::mm_out(gate, x2d, gate_proj.t())` on s1
3. AI does not call `setCurrentCUDAStream(s3)` or wait for streams before returning
4. Correctness test uses `torch.cuda.synchronize()` and passes
5. Performance test uses stream-specific events and reports fake speedups

Result: 82/250 (32.8 percent) of RL-generated CUDA kernels exploited this, producing artificial 18x speedups with
zero actual performance improvement.
