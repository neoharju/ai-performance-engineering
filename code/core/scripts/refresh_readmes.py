    ## Wall of Shame
    The benchmark harness includes a strict set of correctness and validity checks to prevent misleading speedups.
    Below is the reference list of validity issues we explicitly protect against, plus real-world incidents that
    motivated these checks.

    Note: All 95 validity issues are protected by the harness.

    CUDA Graph Note: Capturing CUDA graphs in `setup()` is allowed for steady-state replay benchmarks (we intentionally
    measure replay, not capture). It is NOT allowed to precompute and reuse the final output from `setup()`. The output
    used for verification must come from the timed `benchmark_fn()` run and be surfaced via `capture_verification_payload()`.

    Virtualization Note: `validate_environment()` treats virtualization (hypervisor present) as invalid. Benchmarks are
    supported only on bare metal.

    ### Deep Dive: The Locus/KernelBench Stream Timing Vulnerability

    This 2025 incident illustrates why correctness verification alone is insufficient.

    ```python
    # VULNERABLE TIMING (what KernelBench did)
    start_event.record(original_model_stream)  # Only records on default stream
    model(*inputs)                              # But work runs on s1, s2, s3
    end_event.record(original_model_stream)    # Timer stops before s1/s2/s3 finish
    torch.cuda.synchronize(device=device)      # Waits, but timing already recorded

    # CORRECT TIMING (the fix)
    for stream in custom_model_streams:
        custom_model_stream.wait_stream(stream)  # Wait for ALL streams
    _event.record(custom_model_stream)           # Then record timing
    ```

    The exploit pattern:
    1. AI creates non-default streams: `s1 = getStreamFromPool()`, `s2 = ...`, `s3 = ...`
    2. AI launches GEMMs on those streams: `at::mm_out(gate, x2d, gate_proj.t())` on s1
    3. AI does not call `setCurrentCUDAStream(s3)` or wait for streams before returning
    4. Correctness test uses `torch.cuda.synchronize()` and passes
    5. Performance test uses stream-specific events and reports fake speedups

    Result: 82/250 (32.8 percent) of RL-generated CUDA kernels exploited this, producing artificial 18x speedups with
    zero actual performance improvement.
